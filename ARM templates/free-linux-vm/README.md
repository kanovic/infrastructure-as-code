This template allows a new account to create a free Linux Virtual Machine with free services for 12 months. You can use 750 hours of Linux VM of size B1s per month and 2x 64gb Premium SSD drive which are included in the template. This template also deploys a Virtual Network with an inbound rule allowing only port 22 connections for SSH, a Public IP address, a Public domain namespace, and a Network Interface.

For authentication you can specify a password or a SSH rsa public key. This is typically generated by ssh-keygen, among other tools, on Linux, Mac, or Windows. If you already have an ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file, that will work directly, as you would expect. When deployed using the Azure portal, you should paste in the contents of your ssh-rsa public key file as a string. When you deploy the template from the Azure CLI, when the parameter prompts you for the string, do not surround it in quotes, or they will be treated as part of the public key.
